The Employee Management System using Spring Boot is a web-based application designed to streamline the management of employee data for an organisation. 

This application provides an easy-to-use interface for HR personnel to manage employee information such as personal details, job roles, salary information, and more. 

The application also allows employees to view their own information and make updates to their personal details.
